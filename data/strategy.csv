GONE,"The best thing to do with this customer is do nothing. Because when they have intension to leave, it will very hard to pull they back. On the other side, if we can pull them back, the best result we can do is turn them into the LIKELY GONE customer or the New one. So the better if we save the monney and resource for the other customers."
HOT,"They are the customer we have to priorities to please them with every thing we can do. Do the research of what they like about the company, and listen to what they do not like. From that we can change and update our service to be better."
LIKELY GONE,"They are the old customers who are likely gone, we can do a survey to know what they think and feel about bussiness. Maybe there opinions can help us improve out service."
NEW,"They are new customers who came to us recently. Lets try to do our best, as we did with the HOT customers. To see if we can have more loyal one. We can open some discount to attract them"
PROSPECTIVE,"The top 2 customer we need to care as much as we can. They are regular one, they come to use our service but not much, we they are using long enough. Maybe we can do a survey on them to know what they really think, before do any action. "
